    <!-- All HTML elements can have attributes -->
    <!-- Attributes provide additional information about elements -->
    <!-- Attributes are always specified in the start tag -->
    <!-- Attributes usually come in name/value pairs like: name="value" -->

    <h2>The href Attribute</h2>
    <p>HTML links are defined with the a tag. The link address is specified in the href attribute:</p>
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3Schools</a>

    <!-- The src Attribute in the <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. -->
    <!-- The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: -->
    <h2>The src Attribute</h2>
    <p>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</p>
    <!-- The <img> tag should also contain the width and height attributes, which specify the width and height of the image (in pixels):     -->
    <img src="sourceCode.png" width="500" height="600">

    <!-- There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute: -->
    <!-- 1. Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website. Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg". -->
    <!-- Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it, you may be in violation of copyright laws. -->
    <!-- In addition, you cannot control external images; it can suddenly be removed or changed. -->
    <!-- 2. Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does not include the domain name. -->
    <!-- If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the current page. Example: src="img_girl.jpg". -->
    <!-- If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain. Example: src="/images/img_girl.jpg". -->
    <!-- Tip: It is almost always best to use relative URLs. They will not break if you change domain. -->

    <!-- The required alt attribute for the <img> tag specifies an alternate text for an image, if the image for some reason cannot be displayed. -->
    <!-- This can be due to a slow connection, or an error in the src attribute, or if the user uses a screen reader. -->
    <h2>The alt Attribute</h2>
    <p>If we try to display an image that does not exist, the value of the alt attribute will be displayed instead. </p>
    <img src="wrongIma.png" alt="Image not found">

    <!-- The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color, font, size, and more. -->
    <h2>The style Attribute</h2>
    <p>The style attribute is used to add styles to an element, such as color:</p>
    <p style="color:red;">This is a red paragraph.</p>

    <!-- The value of the title attribute will be displayed as a tooltip when you mouse over the element: -->
    <h2 title="I'm a header">The title Attribute</h2>
    <p title="I'm a tooltip">Mouse over this paragraph, to display the title attribute as a tooltip.</p>

    <!-- Double quotes around attribute values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used. -->
    <!-- In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quotes, it is necessary to use single quotes: -->
