    <!-- All HTML elements can have attributes
    Attributes provide additional information about elements
    Attributes are always specified in the start tag

    <h4>Example of a hyperlink (link) using HTML:</h4>
    <!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specidies the URL of the page the link goes to. -->
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3schools for more tutorials</a>
        
    <!-- The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: -->
    <h4>HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute::</h4>
    <img src="sourceCode.png">

    <!-- There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:

    1 - Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
    Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".
    
    Notes: External images might be under copyright. If you do not get permission to use it,
    you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images;
    it can suddenly be removed or changed.

    2 Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does
    not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the
    current page. 
    
    Example: src='image.jpg'.
    
    If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.

    Example: src="/images/image.jpg" -->
