    <!-- The <a> tag defines a hyperlink. The href attribute specidies the URL of the page the link goes to. -->
    <a href="https://www.w3schools.com">Visit W3schools for more tutorials</a>
        
    <!-- The <img> tag is used to embed an image in an HTML page. The src attribute specifies the path to the image to be displayed: -->
    <h4>2 - HTML images are defined with the img tag, and the filename of the image source is specified in the src attribute:</h4>

    <!-- There are two ways to specify the URL in the src attribute:
        
    1 - Absolute URL - Links to an external image that is hosted on another website.
    Example: src="https://www.w3schools.com/images/img_girl.jpg".

    you may be in violation of copyright laws. In addition, you cannot control external images;
    it can suddenly be removed or changed.
    
    2 Relative URL - Links to an image that is hosted within the website. Here, the URL does
    not include the domain name. If the URL begins without a slash, it will be relative to the
    current page. 
    
    Example: src='image.jpg'.
    
    If the URL begins with a slash, it will be relative to the domain.
    
    Example: src="/images/image.jpg" -->
    
    <h4>3 - Manipulating the image size via width and height (in pixels):</h4>
    <img src="sourceCode.png" alt="Source code of this document" width="800" height="400">
    <!-- The alt attribute should reflect the image content, so users who cannot see the image
    get an understanding of what the image contains -->

    <h4>4 - Trying to display an image that does not exist:</h4>
    <img src="image.png" alt="image not found">
        
    <h4>5 - The style attribute is used to add styles to an elemenst. Such as color, font, size, etc.</h4>
    <p style="color: red;">This is a red paragraph!</p>
    
    <h4>6 - The title attribute defines some extra information about an element:</h4>
    <p title="I am a paragraph in an HTML document!">Hover over this paragraph to see some extra information about it!</p>
    
    <!-- The HTML standard does not require lowercase attribute names.
    The title attribute (and all other attributes) can be written with uppercase or lowercase like title or TITLE.
    However, W3C recommends lowercase attributes in HTML, and demands lowercase attributes for stricter document type like XHTMK. -->

    <!-- Double quotes around attributes values are the most common in HTML, but single quotes can also be used.
    In some situations, when the attribute value itself contains double quote, it is necessary to use single quotes. -->
